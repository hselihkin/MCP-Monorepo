# Agentic AI Assistant with MCP Architecture
This repository contains the source code for a resilient, scalable, and plug-and-play agentic AI assistant. The project is built using ASP.NET Core and C#, and it implements the Multi-agent Convergent Protocol (MCP) design pattern to ensure robust and modular functionality.

# Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create a sophisticated AI assistant that can be easily extended and maintained. By leveraging a modern microservices-style architecture and the MCP design pattern, the system is designed for high performance and scalability, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.

# Key Features
**Resilient and Scalable Architecture**: Built on ASP.NET Core, the system is designed to handle a large number of requests and can be scaled horizontally to meet growing demand.
**Plug-and-Play Modularity**: The architecture allows for the seamless integration of various open-source APIs and internal services, showcasing the system's flexibility and modularity. New capabilities can be added with minimal changes to the core infrastructure.
**Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A comprehensive RBAC service is implemented to ensure secure and granular control over user permissions, protecting sensitive data and functionalities.
**MCP Design Pattern**: The implementation of the Multi-agent Convergent Protocol allows for efficient communication and coordination between different AI agents and services within the system.
